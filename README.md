# sdllib_test
This project is a simple example of how to start with SDL library. Useful for testing IDE configurations, compiler options and etc.


`sdl_video_modes` branch
=========================

In this branch I keep an example of how to enumerate displays, video drivers and video modes that they support.
Also the codebase contains `.vscode` folder which is set up in a way that allows g++ debugging with external terminal window.
